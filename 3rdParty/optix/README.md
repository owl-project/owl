# OptiX Headers

OptiX is an application framework for achieving optimal ray tracing
performance on the GPU.

This repository contains the minimal set of necessary header files for
building an application with OptiX support, including access to the OptiX
functions provided by the NVIDIA display driver.
https://github.com/NVIDIA/optix-dev It is not necessary to use this
repository when installing the complete OptiX SDK; header files are already
included in the OptiX SDK.

For an in-depth introduction to OptiX, to find OptiX documentation, or to
download the complete OptiX SDK including code samples and supporting
libraries, please see the OptiX homepage, located here:
